# PIC-Model-Train-Speedometer
Home made model train speedo, multiple gauges supported

This project started off being based on an Arduino UNO. And it worded ok, I found the software published on the internet. For example https://forum.arduino.cc/t/model-railroad-speedome...

But I wanted to make the device smaller and neater and if possible to improve the software as well. With this version you can program difference GUAGE (z,n,oo,o) using a press switch and you can select pre-set distances between the sensors (30cm, 50cm, 75cm or 100cm). With the 30cm version it's easier to make a "portable" version to use on your layout in different locations etc.

Why choose a PIC? Well mainly I had some left over from another project! But also they are very cheap (the 18F47Q10 was priced at Â£1.47 on microchip direct website, when this article was written) and not too difficult to program.

My other main motivation was to produce my first PCB design for many years!

I have a ready made version and a kit with all the parts ready to go. If you want one look on Ebay for "Model train speedometer"
